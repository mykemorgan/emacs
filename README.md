emacs
=====

Custom emacs elisp files for development. Contains custom written
tools and modes, as well as possible open source stuff that is
useful. 

Note: the file "dot-emacs" is the .emacs file that needs to be in
one's home directory. I just link my .emacs to this file in whatever
directory this repo is put.
